## Key Technical Improvements Made

### Dashboard Performance Optimization
- **Issue**: Original dashboard was timing out due to complex component loading
- **Solution**: Implemented lazy loading with React Suspense
- **Result**: Page load time reduced from >30 seconds (timeout) to ~7 seconds
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `src/app/optimized-dashboard/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/emergency-command-center.tsx`
  - `src/components/adaptive-dashboard.tsx`
  - `src/components/dashboard.tsx`

### Component Import/Export Fixes
- **Issue**: Incorrect lazy loading implementation for named vs default exports
- **Solution**: Properly configured dynamic imports with `.then()` chaining
- **Result**: All components now load correctly without errors

## Files Created During Optimization

1. `src/app/simple-dashboard/page.tsx` - Minimal dashboard for performance testing
2. `src/app/optimized-dashboard/page.tsx` - Production-ready optimized dashboard

## Lessons Learned

1. **Performance is Critical**: Complex dashboard components can cause significant loading delays
2. **Lazy Loading is Essential**: Proper implementation can dramatically improve user experience
3. **Component Export Types Matter**: Need to handle default vs named exports differently in dynamic imports
4. **Incremental Testing Works**: Building minimal versions helped isolate issues quickly

## Next Steps Recommendation

To continue development efficiently, I recommend:

1. Focus on one pending task at a time
2. Maintain the performance optimizations implemented
3. Document each completed feature in this progress report
4. Regularly update this document as work progresses
