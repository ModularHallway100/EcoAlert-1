  },
  "product_overview": "EcoAlert is a scalable environmental monitoring platform providing real-time air quality data, weather information, predictive analytics, emergency management, and community engagement. It integrates IoT sensor data with AI-powered analytics to help users monitor and respond to environmental conditions effectively.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Provide real-time environmental monitoring data with robust sensor integration.",
    "Offer predictive analytics and anomaly detection using AI to forecast pollution trends.",
    "Enable automated and manual emergency alerting and emergency response coordination.",
    "Facilitate community-driven environmental insights, including social engagement and educational content.",
    "Ensure seamless user authentication, profile management, and security.",
    "Support integration with third-party services and platforms via APIs and webhooks.",
    "Maintain high availability, scalability, and security across deployments.",
    "Deliver actionable pollution reduction tips personalized by AI based on current data."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Real-time dashboard showing live air quality and pollution data via multiple sensor sources.",
    "Optimized performance dashboard with lazy loading for improved responsiveness.",
    "Emergency Command Center with manual and automatic emergency triggering, alert popups, alarms, and phone vibration.",
    "Socket.io integration to consume and broadcast real-time sensor data and alerts.",
    "Rich analytics platform providing behavior tracking, predictive forecasts, anomaly detection, and trend reporting.",
    "Comprehensive API covering user profiles, sensors management, air quality, weather data, analytics, social features, educational content, and notifications.",
    "Community participation features including challenges, leaderboards, profiles, and social posts.",
    "Pollution heatmaps and geographic visualization for easy understanding of pollution levels.",
    "User authentication and management using Clerk with Convex backend integration for secure and scalable auth.",
    "AI-generated pollution reduction tips tailored to current pollution readings.",
    "Third-party service integrations and webhook support for extensibility.",
    "Theme customization and reusable UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS for a consistent user experience."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "Users sign up or log in using the authentication system with options for email, Google OAuth, and phone authentication.",
    "Authenticated users land on the dashboard displaying real-time environmental data, including pollution readings and weather info.",
    "Users can monitor pollution via an interactive map and heatmaps, check historical pollution reports and charts.",
    "The system automatically detects emergency conditions based on sensor thresholds and triggers alerts; users can also manually trigger emergency alerts.",
    "Users engage with community features by posting, joining challenges, and viewing leaderboards.",
    "Users access predictive analytics and trend reports generated by AI models to make informed decisions.",
    "Users receive personalized pollution reduction tips based on current pollution levels computed by integrated AI services.",
    "Third-party integrations synchronize data and enable extensions through API endpoints and webhooks.",
    "Admin or authorized users manage sensors, integrations, notifications, and user profiles via secured API endpoints."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "All key features are accessible through the UI and API endpoints and function as specified in the documentation.",
    "Real-time data updates are reflected within 5 seconds on dashboards using Socket.io.",
    "Emergency alert system triggers correctly for both manual and auto detection scenarios and produces audible/visual/vibration alerts on supported devices.",
    "User authentication and session management are secure, with correct role-based access control enforced.",
    "AI-generated pollution tips correlate logically to current pollution data and update dynamically.",
    "API endpoints authenticate requests correctly and return well-structured, paginated responses consistent with documented schemas.",
    "Third-party integrations and webhooks respond and process events in real-time without errors.",
    "Dashboards and data visualizations load efficiently with lazy loading and code splitting, ensuring smooth user experiences.",
    "Monitoring systems produce actionable alerts with low false-positive rates, and logs capture error and usage data reliably.",
    "Deployment procedures complete successfully with environment variables correctly set and services healthy after startup."
