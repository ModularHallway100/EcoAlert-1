**Status**: ⚠️ Needs Enhancement

#### Issues Found:
1. **API Security**
   - Issue: Missing rate limiting on API routes
   - Location: `src/app/api/*` routes
   - Severity: High
   - Recommendation: Implement rate limiting middleware

2. **Data Validation**
   - Issue: Insufficient input validation on forms
   - Location: `src/components/auth-flow.tsx`
   - Severity: Medium
   - Recommendation: Add form validation with Zod schemas

3. **Authentication Tokens**
   - Issue: Tokens stored in localStorage (vulnerable to XSS)
   - Location: `src/components/auth-provider.tsx`
   - Severity: High
   - Recommendation: Use httpOnly cookies for token storage

### 5. Performance Tests (4 test cases)
**Status**: ⚠️ Optimization Needed

#### Issues Found:
1. **Bundle Size**
   - Issue: Large initial bundle size due to heavy dependencies
   - Location: `package.json` and component imports
   - Severity: Medium
   - Recommendation: Implement dynamic imports for heavy libraries

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Issue: Images not optimized for web
   - Location: `src/components/*` with Image components
   - Severity: Low
   - Recommendation: Use Next.js Image component with optimization

3. **Memory Leaks**
   - Issue: Potential memory leaks in useEffect hooks
   - Location: `src/hooks/use-auth.ts` and other hooks
   - Severity: Medium
   - Recommendation: Add proper cleanup in useEffect
